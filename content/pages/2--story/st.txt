#The child: 1984-2002
I was born and spent my childhood in [Veria, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veria). At primary school I got my first PC with the following specs CPU: 33MHz ([Intel-80386](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Intel_80386)), RAM: 4Mb,  HDD: 120Mb, OS: MS-DOS, Win 3.1 ...and Floppy Disks! That was around 1993 when I learned to use DOS command line mostly to play [Civilization I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)) and to experiment with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC). Around 1998 I met for the first time Internet through dial-up connection and I liked a lot chatting in [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC) and later on downloading songs with [Limewire(P2P client)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeWire). At High School I followed the [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) path, my favorite course was Maths and I received distinction at the National Competition Thales of the Hellenic Mathematical Society (1999-2000). I worked for the first time in my life when I was 16 years old as a DJ (rock, metal, punk) at a cafe-bar on the weekends (3 years) and as a factory worker on the summers (4 years). I completed High School with high distinction (18.7 of 20) even though some of my tutors estimated that I would not even pass the season (=grade less than 10 of 20).   

#The dropout: 2003-2009 
In 2003 I was able to enter almost any kind of STEM or medical sciences university in Greece due to my high grades and my relatives wanted me to become a doctor because of the job status and that I had better grades for medicine schools. My choice was to study Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](http://ee.auth.gr/en) seeking creativity and challenge. Eventually I dropped out University after the first semester to look for other paths because i found the classes anti-motivational and sterile. In the meantime I was very active on multiple student communities related to arts and activism and I have been theatre actor (2 years), radio producer(1 year), video & audio producer(2 years) and graphic designer (4 years). I designed my first web site (static HTML) for the students community of Electrical and Computer Enginnering in 2005 with the help of [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver) and deployed it through [OpenSSH-client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH) to the school's server. At the same time I joined the [local wireless community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Thessaloniki) with a StellaDoradus (2.4GHz, grid parabolic, 24dBi) antenna but at the end I used this antenna mostly to leech internet from neighbors. In 2007 i met and joined social media with [mySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) and I was customizing my profile and posts all the time through HTML (loved that feature!).  

#The returning: 2009-2014 
 Even I didn't had a good impression about the school, I liked the field of studies. In 2009 I decided to resume my studies and I had to pass around 40 courses and defend a Thesis (9 semesters, 4.5 years). That was the time that i programmed my first factorial in [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), tried to master [pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) in C programming and experimented with elecatrical and electronic circuits. Between Electronics, Electrical Energy and Telecommunication enginneering I choose as a Major Electrical Energy (=Power) Engineering because it was an interesting unknown field while my school had a good equipped (=many labs/personel) respective department. I had a focus on Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and technical computing. Most projects I completed during my studies received distinctions thanks to design & presentational skills I developed during my dropout years. At 2012 I made a break as I had to do my military service which is obligatory for all men in Greece. In 2014 I completed my thesis with highest distinction, extended my work on a publication and in July 2014 I graduated. Note that again many people including my family to which I'm thankful for their support didn't expect that I could complete this school after the dropout.  

#The academia: 2014-2016   
In August 2014 I started working as Thesis Consultant for engineering students (related to my field) at a private school in Thessaloniki, Greece. In the meantime during July-August 2014 I completed a series of 9 online courses in data science at Coursera. Afterwards I was reached out for a short-term contract as a visiting researcher at Sustainable Energy Lab - UBI in Convilha, Portugal which I accepted. My research proposal was to develop a model for forecasting Photovoltaic Power. After a survey on predictive analytics with a focus on time series forecasting and machine learning with a focus on neural networks and R programming, I completed my project. Although I did like the research experience, I was more thirsty for practical problems and I returned in March 2015 back to Greece to search new paths.
