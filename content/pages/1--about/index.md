# Welcome

This is a personal blog about web development. It is an effort to document and share things and ideas I worked on, related mostly about front end development. The blog itself is also an ongoing experiment exploring [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem and ways of writing and presentation.
