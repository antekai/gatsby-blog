# Welcome

This is a personal blog about web development. It is an effort to document and share things and ideas I worked on, related mostly with front end development. The blog itself is also an ongoing experiment exploring mainly [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem.
